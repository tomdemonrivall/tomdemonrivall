### ~~CNC technicien~~, ~~waiter~~, ~~caterer~~, ~~bartender~~, ~~Accountant~~,  ***Budding coder***

---

I was born **[1025km][1]** away from Brussels. I came in Belgium 7 years ago because of fries, friends and bears ( kinda disapointed about theses ones, have yet to see a wild one, friends told me it was a pronunciation issue).
<br>
I read a lot of fiction, do rock climbing in the week-end when there's a bit of sun, so twice a year since 7 year, recently picked up leather working. And I got into Larp before this whole zombie apocalypse thing.
<br>
<br>
### **Three Surprisings Skills:**
So, my three most surprising skills should be

    1. I can fight with two swords pretty well.
    2. My arranged rums are magnificents, or so they said.
    3. I do great chiken imitations.

I knows it may not be the most impressive ones, but it should be the most surprising.
<br>
<br>
### **Three Best Things ever :**
The three things I like the most in this universe are : 

>* **Books** and Stories
>* **Nature** as a whole :
>    * *forests*, 
>    * *rivers* 
>    * *mountains*
>    * *critters etc...*
>* **[Otters][2]**, otters are awesome!
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>

### **The Final goals:**

As a developer at the end of the Becode bootcamp I want to be able to fully be a part of the IT world, I just put a foot in it, and there's so much I don't know. I want to learn a set of competences with which I will be able to find works I actually enjoy doing, and people who will pay me for doing it. For now I enjoy learning new stuff, I hope at the end of the 7 month I still will.
<br>
<br>

### **The obstacles within**
It is just the start, so of course I have some apprehensions, I fear not being good enough, I fear losing my motivation, I fear doing too much insomnia and be too exausted to be effective. But it's useless to overthink about futur problems right now.
<br>
<br>

### **Medium Term Objectives**
One of the thing I look forward is being good enough to start building stuff with code, it appear quite distant for now.
<br>
<br>

### **How to make a good team**
The three things I value the most to work as a team are:

    - First a shared sense of humor between the members, 
    - Second, motivation do actually do some work  
    - And last, patience for the other and for yourself.

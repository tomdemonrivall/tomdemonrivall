I was born **[1025km][1]** away from Brussels. I came in Belgium 7 years ago because of fries, friends and bears ( kinda disapointed about theses ones, have yet to see a wild one, friends told me it was a syntaxe issue).
<br>
I read a lot of fiction, do rock climbing in the week-end when there's a bit of sun, recently picked up leather working. And I got into Larp before this whole zombie apocalypse thing.
<br>

### **Three Surprisings Skills:**
So, my three most surprising skills should be

    1. I can fight with two swords pretty well.
    2. My arranged rums are magnificents, or so they said.
    3. I do great chiken imitations.

I knows it may not be the most impressive ones, but it should be the most surprising.
<br>

### **The Bootcamp goals:**

As a developer at the end of the Becode bootcamp I want to be able to fully be a part of the IT world, I just put a foot in it, and there's so much I don't know. I want to learn a set of competences with which I will be able to find works I actually enjoy doing.
<br>
<br>


### **On How to make a good team: **
The three things I value the most to work as a team are:

    - First a shared sense of humor between the members, 
    - Second, motivation do actually do some work  
    - And last, patience for the other and for yourself.
